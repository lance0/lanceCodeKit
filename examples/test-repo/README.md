# Example Test Repo

This is a minimal project you can use to verify the `Gemini` and `Context7` MCP servers.
It includes a simple script that prints a greeting. Use it to experiment with the
slash commands defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

```bash
# clone this example separately
git clone https://github.com/your-user/lanceCodeKit.git
cd lanceCodeKit/examples/test-repo
```

Run Claude inside this folder and try commands like:

```
/gemini-query How do I print hello world in Python?
/context7 numpy array
```
